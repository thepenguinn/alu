# An implementation of a basic 16 bit ALU

This project aims to design and implement a basic 16 bit ALU which performs the
operations sequentially with a 1 bit ALU having 3 bit wide opcodes, and having
the ability to ADD, SUB and perform 6 other logical operations.

# What's done

The design and implementation in verilog is done. And the alutester is almost
done. The documentation is still in wip.
